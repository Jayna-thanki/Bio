With a strong foundation in Angular, JavaScript, Java, and various front-end languages, I work on both internal and client projects. My commitment to agile development keeps me updated with the latest trends in software engineering.

My skill set spans web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, Java, C#, .Net, Node.js, Express.js, SQL, RxJS, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Git. I am adept at TDD, CI/CD, RESTful APIs, WordPress, SEO, Storybook, Figma, Tailwind, and project management tools like Jira and Kanban.

I excel in communication, time management, teamwork, and meeting deadlines. My innovative approach, leadership, and strategic planning skills, combined with my ability to manage performance, budgets, and risks, make me a dynamic and adaptable problem-solver, ready to tackle new challenges and contribute to the success of my team and projects.
